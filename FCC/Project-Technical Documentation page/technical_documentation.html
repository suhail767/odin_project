          <p>
            Wayne Mark Rooney (born 24 October 1985) is an English football
            manager and former player who currently manages Championship club
            Derby County, for which he previously served as interim player-
            manager. He spent much of his playing career as a forward while
            also being used in various midfield roles. Widely considered to be
             one of the best players of his generation, Rooney is the record
             goalscorer for both the England national team and Manchester
             United.
          </p>
          <p>
          Rooney joined the Everton youth team at the age of nine and made his
          professional debut for the club in 2002 at the age of 16. He spent
          two seasons at the Merseyside club, before moving to Manchester
          United for £25.6 million in the 2004 summer transfer window where
          he won 16 trophies and became the only English player, alongside
          teammate Michael Carrick, to win the Premier League, FA Cup, UEFA
           Champions League, League Cup, UEFA Europa League, and FIFA Club
           World Cup. He scored 253 goals for United in all
           competitions to make him their top goalscorer of all time, with
           183 Premier League goals being the most scored by a player for
           any single club. Rooney's 208 Premier League goals make him the
           Premier League's second-top scorer of all time. He also has the
           third-highest number of assists in the Premier League, with 103.

        <article>
          <p>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro born 5 February 1985) is a
            Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for
            Serie A club Juventus and captains the Portugal national team.
            Often considered the best player in the world and widely regarded
            as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five
            Ballon d'Or awards[note 3] and four European Golden Shoes, both of
            which are records for a European player. He has won 31 major
            trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA
            Champions Leagues, one UEFA European Championship, and one UEFA
            Nations League title. Ronaldo holds the records for the most goals
             (134) and assists (42) in the history of the UEFA Champions League
             .[10] He is one of the few recorded players to have made over
             1,000 professional career appearances and has scored a record 770
              senior career goals for club and country.[11] He is also the
              second male to score 100 international goals and the first
              European one to achieve the feat.[12]
            </p>
            <p>
              Born and raised in Madeira, Ronaldo began his senior club
              career playing for Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester
              United in 2003, aged 18. After winning the FA Cup in his first
              season, he helped United win three successive Premier League
              titles, the UEFA Champions League, and the FIFA Club World Cup;
               at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. In 2009, Ronaldo was
                the subject of the then-most expensive association football
                 transfer when signed for Real Madrid in a transfer worth €94
                  million (£80 million).

              Paul Scholes (/skoʊlz/ SKOHLZ; born 16 November 1974) is an
              English football coach and former player, as well as a co-owner
               of Salford City. He spent his entire professional playing career
                with Manchester United, for whom he scored over 150 goals in
                 more than 700 appearances between 1993 and 2013. His first
                  managerial position was at Oldham Athletic, for 31 days in
                   February and March 2019. He also served as interim manager
                    of Salford City in October 2020.
            </p>
            <p>
              Scholes came through the Manchester United youth academy as one
              of Fergie's Fledglings (a group of players recruited by
              Manchester United under the management of Sir Alex Ferguson).
              Scholes made his full debut for Manchester United in the 1994–95
              season. He went on to make 718 appearances for United, the
              third-highest number of appearances by any player for the club.
               Scholes announced his retirement from playing in May 2011 and
               was appointed as a coach at Manchester United.

            Nemanja Vidić (Serbian Cyrillic: Немања Видић, Serbian
            pronunciation: [němaɲa ʋǐːditɕ];[3] born 21 October 1981) is a
            Serbian retired professional footballer. He most notably played
            for Manchester United from 2006 to 2014, and was part of the
             Serbia national team from 2002 to 2011.[4] He was widely
             considered to be the world's best centre-back in his prime due
             to his defensive consistency and awareness, as well as his
             strength, leadership, and ability in the air, and is now
             considered one of the finest of his generation.[note 1] He is
             one of only three players to win the Premier League Player of
             the Season award twice, alongside Thierry Henry and Cristiano
             Ronaldo.[9]
          </p>
          <p>
            After establishing himself at Red Star Belgrade during the early
            2000s, Vidić moved to Spartak Moscow in the summer of 2004.
            He further garnered breakout attention when he was part of the
            "Famous Four" Serbia and Montenegro national team defence that
            conceded just one goal during the 2006 FIFA World Cup
            qualification campaign, prompting a £7 million transfer to
            Manchester United in January 2006.

            David de Gea Quintana (Spanish pronunciation:
            [daˈβið ðe ˈxea kinˈtana]; born 7 November 1990) is a Spanish
            professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Premier
            League club Manchester United and the Spain national team. He
            is regarded to be one of the best goalkeepers in the world.
          </p>

          <p>
            Born in Madrid and raised in nearby Illescas, De Gea began his
            playing career with Atlético Madrid, rising through the academy
            system at the club before making his senior debut in 2009, aged
            18. After being made Atlético's first-choice goalkeeper, he
            helped the team win the UEFA Europa League and the UEFA Super
            Cup in 2010. His performances subsequently attracted the attention
             of Manchester United, and De Gea joined the club in June 2011
             for £18.9 million, a British record for a goalkeeper at the time.
